    "__content": "\n\nChances are that you've heard of Webpack by now. A lot of people are praising it, and a lot of people are struggling with learning it. I definitely fell in the latter category, and that is why I decided to write this short tutorial on how to get up and running with Webpack.\n\n### What is Webpack?\n\nShort story is that Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It processes your application and packages all the modules your application needs into a small number of bundles to be loaded by the browser.\n\n### Installation\n\nLet's start by creating a simple `package.json` in the root of your project. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal.\n\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nYou then need to install webpack in order to use it in your application.\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\n### Create the necessary folders and files\n\n**You can skip this step if you already have an existing project for this tutorial.**\n\nLet's create a simple app for demo purposes. Create a folder named `app`, and a file named `index.js` inside it.\n\n#### app/index.js\n\n```\nconst myFunction = () => {\n  console.log('webpack is cool!');\n}\n\nmyFunction();\n```\n\nCreate a new folder named `dist`, and add a file named `index.html` inside it.\n\n#### dist/index.html\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n  </body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\nYour folder structure should now look like this:\n\n```markup\n├── app\n|   ├── index.js\n├── dist\n|   ├── index.html\n└── package.json\n```\n\nYou then need to add a npm script to run the webpack command. So in your package.json, you can simply add the following to scripts:\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\",\n  \"build\": \"webpack\"\n}\n```\n\nRunning `npm run build` will not work yet because you need to create a `webpack.config.js` file first.\n\n### Create the config file\n\nCreate a file called `webpack.config.js` in the root of your application. This is where we will configure webpack to do what we want.\n\nOpen the `webpack.config.js` file in your favorite code editor, and start by importing `path`.\n\n#### webpack.config.js\n\n```\nvar path = require('path');\n```\n\nWe're then going to create the webpack object:\n\n#### webpack.config.js\n\n```\nvar path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n};\n```\n\n### Define the entry and output points\n\nNext, we want to tell webpack the main entry point for our application. Our main entry point is the `index.js` file located inside the `app` folder.\n\n#### webpack.config.js\n\n```\nvar path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './app/index.js'\n};\n```\n\nWebpack also needs to know where to put the bundled file, so next we are going to define the output values. The first one is what you want the file to be called - the default here is `bundle.js`. You will then want to tell webpack to put the bundled file in your `dist` folder.\n\n#### webpack.config.js\n\n```\nvar path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './app/index.js',\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')\n  }\n};\n```\n\nYou can now run the command `npm run build`, and voila - your `index.js` file is now processed by webpack and placed in your dist folder renamed to `bundle.js`.\n\nGo back to your `index.html` file and import the `bundle.js` file right before your closing `body` tag.\n\n#### dist/index.html\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\n\nOpen `index.html` in your browser, and you will now see our message in the console. Pretty cool, right? \n\n**This is the very first step of how to create a webpack config. In a later tutorial, I will explain how to use webpack to compile your `scss` and a few other cool things.**\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "__content": "\n\nWelcome to my first blog post! I decided to kick this off with a small tutorial on how to create a spinning wheel with CSS and Tweenmax. If you make anything cool with it, let me know at <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/marisafari\" target=\"_blank\">@marisafari</a> 😃\n\n### Here is what we'll be making (give it a spin!):\n\n<p data-height=\"805\" data-theme-id=\"29654\" data-slug-hash=\"bWmyoM\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"marijoha\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Spinning wheel\" class=\"codepen\" />\n\nYou can view the <a href=\"http://codepen.io/marijoha/pen/bWmyoM\" target=\"_blank\">original Codepen here</a>.\n\nOkay, let's get started! \n\n## 1. Create the wheel\n\nFirst of all, let's create the wheel and the colors inside it.\n\n\n<span class=\"pro-tip\">\n  **Pro-tip:** Use <a href=\"https://emmet.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Emmet</a> to create this in one line.\n  `div.spinning-wheel>div.color*24`\n</span>\n\n#### HTML for the spinning wheel\n\n```markup\n<div class=\"spinning-wheel\">\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n#### SCSS for the main wheel\n\n```css\n.spinning-wheel {\n  width: 600px;\n  height: 600px;\n  position: relative;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 50%);\n  transition: 2s ease;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  z-index: 1;\n}\n```\n\nI used <a href=\"http://sipapp.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Sip</a> to easily pick all the colors I needed (I used Jamie XX's album In Colors as inspiration). Sip also gives you the option to export your palette as SCSS variables, so I did that and then grouped them all into one list called `$colors`.\n\n#### SCSS for the wheel colors\n\n```\n$rich-carmine: #dc0838;\n$razzmatazz: #e00758;\n$dogwood-rose: #df1970;\n$vivid-cerise: #e5177b;\n$medium-violet-red: #d80681;\n$medium-violet-fra: #be107f;\n$dark-purple: #881f7e;\n$kingfisher-daisy: #5c2579;\n$minsk: #3f297e;\n$yale-blue: #1a3f8d;\n$fun-blue: #1e61af;\n$curious-blue: #2784c9;\n$cerulean: #169ed8;\n$java: #1fa19f;\n$elf-green: #209b6c;\n$north-texas-green: #1a9c42;\n$apple: #5eb236;\n$rio-grande: #b0cc22;\n$dandelion: #f0e622;\n$candlelight: #fbd614;\n$sun: #f9a416;\n$tango: #f07a16;\n$pomegranate: #e6471d;\n$cg-red: #e7302a;\n$utah-crimson: #D70837;\n\n$colors: $rich-carmine $razzmatazz $dogwood-rose $vivid-cerise $medium-violet-red $medium-violet-fra $dark-purple $kingfisher-daisy $minsk $yale-blue $fun-blue $curious-blue $cerulean $java $elf-green $north-texas-green $apple $rio-grande $dandelion $candlelight $sun $tango $pomegranate $cg-red $utah-crimson;\n```\n\nUse a for-loop to go through each color and give it the correct background color and rotate it slightly more than the previous color shape. We're modifying the last color a bit in order to make it fit into the circle.\n\n#### SCSS for the color shapes\n\n```\n@for $i from 1 through 25 {\n  .color:nth-child(#{$i}) {\n    transform: rotate(-#{$i * 15}deg);\n    transform-origin: left;\n    background-color: nth($colors, $i);\n  }\n}\n\n.color:last-child {\n  clip-path: polygon(0 50%, 100% 65%, 100% 0%);\n  transform: rotate(-365deg);\n}\n```\n\nAnd there you go! We have a nice and colorful spinning wheel created with SCSS and HTML only.\n\n<p data-height=\"853\" data-theme-id=\"29654\" data-slug-hash=\"RVqdvY\" data-user=\"marijoha\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Spinning wheel part 1\" class=\"codepen\" />\n\n## 2. Add the tick\n\nWe want the spinning wheel to have a tick on the top of it, so let's go ahead and add that.\n\n#### HTML for the tick\n\nPlace the HTML for the tick above the spinning wheel HTML.\n\n```\n<div class=\"tick\"></div>\n<div class=\"spinning-wheel\">\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n  <div class=\"color\"></div>\n...\n```\n\n#### SCSS for the tick\n\n```\n.tick {\n  width: 2rem;\n  height: 6rem;\n  background-color: #333;\n  margin-bottom: -2rem;\n  z-index: 2;\n  position: relative;\n  clip-path: polygon(50% 100%, 0 0, 100% 0);\n  transform-origin: top;\n}\n```\n\nAnd there's our tick! Nice job.\n\n<p data-height=\"810\" data-theme-id=\"29654\" data-slug-hash=\"bWQZyX\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"marijoha\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Spinning wheel part 2\" class=\"codepen\" />\n\n## 3. Animate the wheel\n\nWe want the user to be able to drag the wheel and make it spin. Luckily, <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/#/HTML5/GSAP/\" target=\"_blank\">GSAP</a> offers just the right solution for us with <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/#/HTML5/GSAP/Utils/Draggable/\" target=\"_blank\">Draggable</a>.\n\n#### JS for the spinning wheel\n\n```\n  const tick = document.querySelector('.tick');\n  const circles = document.querySelector('.spinning-wheel');\n\n  const myDraggable = Draggable.create(circles, {\n    type:\"rotation\",\n    throwProps: true,\n  });\n```\n\nI bet you're expecting more JavaScript right now, but that's it - we're done! Super easy, right?\n\nCheck out our finished spinning wheel (and give it a drag!):\n\n<p data-height=\"810\" data-theme-id=\"29654\" data-slug-hash=\"bWmyoM\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"marijoha\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Spinning wheel\" class=\"codepen\" />\n\n## 5. Browser support\n\nIf you view the wheel in Firefox, you'll discover that none of the clip-paths are being applied properly. This is because Firefox currently only supports clip-paths from SVG's. So in order to fix our problem we can add a couple of SVG's with the clip-paths we need, and then reference them in the CSS.\n\n#### HTML for the SVG clip-paths\n\n```\n<!-- For Firefox support -->\n<svg width=\"0\" height=\"0\">\n  <defs>\n    <clipPath id=\"polygon-shape\" clipPathUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 .50, 1 1, 1 0\" />\n    </clipPath>\n  </defs>\n</svg>\n\n<!-- For Firefox support -->\n<svg width=\"0\" height=\"0\">\n  <defs>\n    <clipPath id=\"tick-shape\" clipPathUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\">\n      <polygon points=\".50 1, 0 0, 1 0\" />\n    </clipPath>\n  </defs>\n</svg>\n```\n\nTo figure out the points needed for the polygon, you simply need to divide the percentage value by 100. So 50% = .50.\n\n#### CSS for the SVG clip-paths\n\n```\n.tick {\n  width: 2rem;\n  height: 6rem;\n  background-color: #333;\n  margin-bottom: -2rem;\n  z-index: 2;\n  position: relative;\n  clip-path: polygon(50% 100%, 0 0, 100% 0);\n  // For Firefox support\n  clip-path: url(\"#tick-shape\");\n  transform-origin: top;\n}\n\n.color {\n  width: 600px;\n  height: 270px;\n  clip-path: polygon(0 50%, 100% 100%, 100% 0%);\n  right: -300px;\n  top: 150px;\n  position: absolute;\n  z-index: 2;\n  // For Firefox support\n  clip-path: url(\"#polygon-shape\");\n}\n```\n\nThe wheel is now rendering as expected in Firefox as well as Chrome and Safari (IE does not support clip-path).\n"
