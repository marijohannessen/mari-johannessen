Lowercase jquery is used because AMD module names are\n\t// derived from file names, and jQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase\n\t// file name. Do this after creating the global so that if an AMD module wants\n\t// to call noConflict to hide this version of jQuery, it will work.\n\t\n\t// Note that for maximum portability, libraries that are not jQuery should\n\t// declare themselves as anonymous modules, and avoid setting a global if an\n\t// AMD loader is present. jQuery is a special case.
